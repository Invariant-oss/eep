EEP 57: Implement joint conditional matches in the case statement
----



Abstract
========

Currently Erlang only supports a list of independent matches in
the body, so that each match results in the invocation of its
specific body.

This proposal extends the syntax to allow multiple matches to
share the same body.



Specification
=============

Currently, a case statement looks like this:

    case I of
      1 -> less_than_three;
      2 -> less_than_three;
      3 -> less_than_ten;
      _ -> other
    end.

This should be changed to allow:

    case I of
      1 | 2 -> less_than_three;
      3     -> less_than_ten;
      _     -> other
    end.



Rationale
=========

Implementation of this proposal would lead to a more
convenient way to code redundant matching clauses, and
would eliminate code duplication.

Example of where this could be useful can be found in
many places in the existing OTP code. E.g. ssl_logger.erl:

    case logger:compare_levels(Level, debug) of
        lt ->
            ?LOG_DEBUG(#{direction => Direction,
                         protocol => Protocol,
                         message => Message},
                       #{domain => [otp,ssl,Protocol]});
        eq ->
            ?LOG_DEBUG(#{direction => Direction,
                         protocol => Protocol,
                         message => Message},
                       #{domain => [otp,ssl,Protocol]});
        _ ->
            ok
    end.

    case logger:compare_levels(Level, notice) of
        lt ->
            ?LOG_NOTICE(Report);
        eq ->
            ?LOG_NOTICE(Report);
        _ ->
            ok
    end.



Backwards Compatibility
=======================

Any code that uses the legacy implementation of the case
statement will continue to work as it does today and produce
the same results.



Reference Implementation
========================

None.
